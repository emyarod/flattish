## Features

Flattish draws heavily from Material Design, from its animations to color palettes to components, including buttons, cards, dialogs, lists, menus, tabs, and more.

### Material components and animations

Tabs and buttons will trigger animations and effects on hovering or clicking.

### Addons

Flattish can be extended with several addons.

#### Large header

This addon will increase the height of the header to accomodate larger images. Large header images should be 420px tall.

#### Rotating header image

When you load a page on your subreddit, this addon will randomly choose from a selection of header images in the stylesheet and alternate between the choices. This addon requires a minimum of 2 header images to alternate between, while supporting up to 36 unique headers.

Examples of this addon in action can be seen on subreddits like [/r/kpop](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop)

#### Sidebar image

Display an image on the sidebar of your subreddit. Sidebar images should be 330px wide. Depending on the height of your image, you will have to edit the base CSS. Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/emyarod/flattish/wiki) for more details.

#### Pinned topics

Pin important announcements, content, or resources next to the main list of posts. Pinned content can be in the form of links or dropdown menus. Choose from seven different icons to represent each pinned item. Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/emyarod/flattish/wiki) for more details.
